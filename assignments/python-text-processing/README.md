# 📘 Assignment: Python Text Processing

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to work with strings, files, and text manipulation in Python. Practice reading and writing files, searching and replacing text, and analyzing word frequency.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ String Manipulation

#### Description
Write a function that takes a string and returns the string reversed, with all vowels removed.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Accept a string as input
- Remove all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from the string
- Return the reversed version of the modified string
- Example: Input: "Hello World" → Output: "dlrW llH"

### 🛠️ File I/O and Text Search

#### Description
Create a program that reads a text file and counts how many times a specific word appears.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Prompt the user for a filename and a word to search for
- Read the file and count the number of times the word appears (case-insensitive)
- Print the count to the user
- Example: Searching for "python" in a file containing "Python is fun. python is powerful." should return 2

### 🛠️ Word Frequency Analysis

#### Description
Write a function that analyzes a text file and prints the top 5 most frequent words.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Read a text file
- Count the frequency of each word (case-insensitive)
- Print the top 5 most frequent words and their counts
- Ignore punctuation and common stop words (e.g., the, and, is, in, to)

## 🎯 Objective

Learn and practice fundamental Python programming skills: user input, string formatting, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ User Input and String Formatting

#### Description
Implement a function `welcome_message()` that interacts with the user and returns a formatted welcome message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Prompt the user for their name, age, and favorite color using `input()`.

#### Description
Create a function `add_two_numbers()` that asks the user for two numbers and prints their sum.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
- Add the numbers together.
- Print the result. Example:
  ```
  Enter the first number: 3
  Enter the second number: 7
  10
  ```

### 🛠️ Conditional Statements

#### Description
Write a function `is_even()` that checks if a number is even.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Take a single integer argument.
- Return `True` if the number is even, and `False` if it is odd.
